# scSCOPE
It is challenging to select marker genes robustly to discriminate cell types with meaningful cellular functions. Here, we propose an extension of our bulk RNA-seq tool, Stabilized COre gene and Pathway Election, or SCOPE, to identify marker genes and pathways in single-cell RNA-seq data (scRNA-seq). The new tool, single-cell-SCOPE, or scSCOPE, integrates LASSO, Co-expression analyses, Pathway Enrichment and Differential Expression to identify marker genes and pathways in single-cell data.
